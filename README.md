This project is part of the SQL Developer Internship
Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping. 
I used pgAdmin 4 to write and execute SQL queries on the emp table.

In this task, I applied aggregate functions like AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX, and COUNT to analyze the employee data.
I also used the GROUP BY clause to group the results by department or other columns. 
To filter grouped results, I used the HAVING clause.

This helped me understand how to summarize and analyze tabular data using grouping and aggregate functions in SQL.

The project includes:
A SQL file with all queries used in this task and PDF file os screenshot of outputs taken from pgAdmin 4
